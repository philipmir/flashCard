# FU_CardDeck

Creating a simple card game app where the user will guess if the next card will be higher or lower than the current card.

There will be three activities where the first one is a basic "start up new game".

In the next activity the user will start a new round and start playing.

In the last activity there will be a "you won" or "you lost" screen, where the user can choose to quit playing or start again.
