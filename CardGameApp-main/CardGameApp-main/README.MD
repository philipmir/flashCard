# CardGameAndroid

This is a cardgame app for Android devices.

The game starts when you open the app and gets presented with a card deck where the top card is revealed.

The game is about guessing if the next card in the deck has a higher or a lower value.
This is represented of two buttons under the card-deck in activity one.


If you guessed right, one point will be added to the right counter in the top left corner.

If you guessed wrong, then one point will be added to the wrong counter directly under the right counter.

A round is won when you have guessed right 12 times, if you have guessed wrong 3 times before you reach 12 the round is lost.



In either of the scenarios, you get transferred to activity 2 where a message if you won or lost is displayed
then you get asked if you want to play another round.
